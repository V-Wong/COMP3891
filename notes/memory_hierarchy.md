## Caching
Speed up access by using faster storage as a **cache** for slower storage.

Faster storage holds a **subset of the data** from the slower storage. Exploits **principle of locality** where **recently accessed data** is likely to be accessed in the **near future**.

### CPU Cache
CPU cache is **fast memory** between CPU and RAM. Holds **recently used** data or instructions to **save memory accesses**.

### Caching Disk Access
Keep a subset of disk data in main memory. Minimises access to hard disk, greatly improving performance

### Caching Internet Access
Keep a subset of the internet's data on disk. Minimises network access, greatly improving performance.
